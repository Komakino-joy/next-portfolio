  My name is Bryan Alvarez, I am a full time software engineer and do some freelancing on the side.  
  My motivation comes from two places: desire to continuously expand my expertise in the ever-changing field of software engineering; 
  the satisfaction that comes with finding a solution to challenging problems. 
  Along the way I have picked up valuable complimentary skills in customer service, employee relations, leadership, teamwork, data analysis, and system administration.
